// At first I thought the game was too easy so I implimented an impact methoed when you get hit by an obstacle, that it slows you down and removes time.
//creating this took many hours but I am glad it worked in the end


//2 changes I would have made (I did make) is to punish the player harder when you do get hit by the obstacles and greatly help them get back to their orignial point
// when touching a power up. To make it a bit harder on the self, I will be changing the speed of obstacles and lowering the start time
// from 10 seconds to 8 seconds

//2 things that can give this game a wow factor is your own custum imported models you had made yourself. instead of just cubes and spheres
//make it 3d models you have made like jewels and bad guys.
//another thing to give it a wow factor is changing up the skybox. purple is cool and all but giving it some color or some kind of scenery would be nice
//and also chaning the platform would be a nice change for the eyes

//2 parts of the game that are fun for me is using the phase in and out feature when you press space. makes you have to think of your next moves very carfully 
// and another thing editing the collider code to make it more punishing if the player runs into the obstacle even though it will end up making you lose in the long run

// 2 parts of the game that are tedious is the distance in which to have to move horizontally accross the board to maybe grab that one powerup but end up getting caught and losing a second or two
// and other thing being how bland the scene looks. maybe a custom theme like you being a pirate on a SUPER long island where the powerup is gold and the obstacles are other pirates or EVEN CRABS

// first change I made to the obstacle is a lamp pose prefab we made a bit ago . thought it would be more fitting since it is an actual object
// the second change I made is for the powerup chaning the shape, color and various sizes (editing the code)
